## What it Solves 
This notebook demonstrates an intelligent agent system that answers user queries by combining internal knowledge and live web data. It efficiently handles queries that need up-to-date information from the internet.

## Example 
### User query: 
"What is square root of 25? and What is apple stock health on 22 Jan 2025"

### Agents Output: 

The square root of 25 is **5**.

Regarding the health of Apple stock on January 22, 2025, here are the key points:

1. **Sales Decline**: Apple faced an **18.2% decline in iPhone sales** specifically in China during the December quarter, leading to a drop in stock price by **4.4%**. Analysts expressed concerns regarding the ongoing decline in sales.

2. **Analysts' Downgrades**: This sales drop prompted several analysts to downgrade their ratings on Apple stock, signaling worries about weak iPhone sales in a challenging consumer electronics market.

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: By January 21, 2025, Appleâ€™s stock entered an **oversold territory**, with an RSI reading of **28.2**. This suggests that selling pressure was potentially exhausting, indicating possible buying opportunities.

4. **Price Observations**: On January 22, 2025, Apple's shares were trading around **$220.09**. The stock had experienced significant fluctuations over the year, with a **52-week low of $164.075** and a high of **$260.10**.

5. **Consumer Sentiment and Strategy Issues**: Analysts observed that Apple's pricing strategy was not resonating well with many Chinese consumers, who tended to prefer more affordable options from local manufacturers.

This combination of factors indicates a challenging environment for Apple stock, with caution advised for potential investors despite some indicators suggesting possible future upside.

## How it Works ðŸ”§
- **LangChain** powers the AI with GPT to generate responses.
- **Tavily API** fetches relevant URLs when the agent needs to pull in live information.
- **LangGraph** manages the flow, deciding when to answer directly and when to use the web.

### Key Components:
1. **get_urls**: Uses Tavily API to fetch relevant URLs.
2. **convert_html_to_markdown**: Converts HTML content into markdown format.
3. **Flow**: The agent first tries to answer directly, then pulls information from the web when needed.

## Flow Diagram ðŸ”„

### 1. **General Agent Node**:
   - The first step is to process the user query.
   - If the agent has enough knowledge, it answers the query directly.
   - If it needs more information, it sends the query to the **Internet Agent** node.

### 2. **Internet Agent Node**:
   - This node fetches relevant URLs based on the query using the **get_urls** tool (via Tavily).
   - It then converts the HTML content of those URLs into markdown format using the **convert_html_to_markdown** tool.
   - After retrieving and converting the data, it sends this information back to the **General Agent** node.

### 3. **Combining Responses**:
   - The **General Agent** then combines the answer from its internal knowledge and the markdown content from the internet.
   - It provides a complete, concise response to the user.


## Conclusion ðŸ’¡
This system seamlessly combines pre-existing knowledge with real-time data, providing accurate answers by pulling from both internal and web sources.
